        <p class="bio-text">
          I am a second-year undergraduate double majoring in Math-Computer
          Science and Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts at UC San 
          Diego. I enjoy coding not only because of the endless creative 
          possibilities that it holds, but also the gratifying experiences 
          that the end product provides to users. Though computer science is
          a vast field, I'm eager to explore its multitude of pathways, 
          learn whatever I can, and face any challenges presented to me. 
          Outside of computer science, I also enjoy playing piano and guitar, 
          composing music, playing tennis, jogging at the beach, and hanging 
          out with my friends.
